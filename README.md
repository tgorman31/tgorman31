### Hi there 👋

My name is Thomas, I am a mostly hobbist developer but do a lot in VBA in Excel in my day to day work. 

I am my departments excel & macro wizard (there is always one)🧙‍♂️

I've been looking at expanding my coding repotoire and get more cosistent with programming. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a VBA Construction Project Cost Management Tool
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go & C#
- ☑️ I've just completed a [file-organiser](https://github.com/tgorman31/file-organiser) in Go
- ☑️ I've just completed the [Microsoft Power-Up Challenge](https://github.com/tgorman31/AnimalShelter)

  
My project todo list (in no particular order):
- [x] file-organiser
- [ ] Pomodoro timer
- [ ] F45 Meal Planner
- [ ] Spotify TUI player
- [ ] GPT-4 Chat Wrapper
- [ ] Obsidian.md Clone
- [ ] Project Cost Management Tool (clone of excel work tool)
- [ ] Beaver Wizard (AI life assistant)
- [ ] Project Management Tool
- [ ] Personal Website
- [ ] Dwarf Fortress World Gen Clone
- [ ] AI Assisted Document Creator
<!--

Other Ideas:
 - [ ] Running safety app matching runners with training buddies
 - [ ] Live streaming app for DJ's to stream music direct to party's
 - [ ] Asset and Project Management SaaS with BIM functionality
